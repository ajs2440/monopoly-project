- Presentation Materials, e.g., here&rsquo;s a [sample presentation](https://github.com/calvin-cs262-organization/monopoly-project/blob/master/presentations/presentation.pptx)

- Other documents, e.g., here&rsquo;s a [sample test script](https://github.com/calvin-cs262-organization/monopoly-project/blob/master/testing/csWebsiteTestScript.pdf). 

The raw documents for these deliverables should be checked into this project repo.

You will publish the following materials elsewhere:

- the codebases for your client and for your server will be separate repos
in your team organization 
(e.g., see this [sample organization](https://github.com/calvin-cs262-organization/)).
- your project management materials will be included in your team Trello board 
(e.g., see this [sample Trello board](https://trello.com/b/WpvdqCbd/cs262-overview)) 
and in your GitHub repos.
